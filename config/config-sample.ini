[security]
; It is important that SKA is able to verify that it has connected to the
; server that it expected to connect to (otherwise it could be tricked into
; syncing the wrong keys to a server). The simplest way to accomplish this is
; through SSH host key verification. Setting either of the 2 options below to
; '0' can weaken the protection that SSH host key verification provides.

; Determine who can reset a server's SSH host key in SKA:
;  0: Allow server admins to reset the SSH host key for servers that they
;     administer
;  1: Full SKA admin access is required to reset a server's host key
host_key_reset_restriction = 1

; Determine what happens if multiple servers have the same SSH host key:
;  0: Allow sync to proceed
;  1: Abort sync of affected servers and report an error
; It is not recommended to leave this set to '0' indefinitely
host_key_collision_protection = 1


; Hostname verification is a supplement to SSH host key verification for
; making sure that the sync process has connected to the server that it
; expected to.

; Determine how hostname verification is performed:
;  0: Do not perform hostname verification
;  1: Compare with the result of `hostname -f`
;  2: Compare with /var/local/keys-sync/.hostnames, fall back to `hostname -f`
;     if the file does not exist
;  3: Compare with /var/local/keys-sync/.hostnames, abort sync if the file
;     does not exist
; The last option provides the most solid verification, as a server will only
; be synced to if it has been explicitly allowed on the server itself.
